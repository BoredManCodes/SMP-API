## SpigotMC page:

# Available Endpoints
All API calls must include a `secret` header the value of which is set in the config.yml.

The plugin will refuse to load if you don't set a secret to prevent leaking player IP's and base locations.

API call failed due to invalid secret header:
```json
{
    "error":true,
    "message":"You are not authourised to access this resource"
}
```
Log output on failed authentication:
```log
[SMP-API] A request to access Minecraft info from 206.189.205.251 was rejected 
as they did not pass the correct secret in the header
```

# Configuration
The config is pretty simple. This is the default:
```yml
debug: false
port: 25567
secret: CHANGE THIS!
```
| key    | definition                                                             |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| debug  | Whether debug messages should be logged to console                     |
| port   | The port to host the API on.<br/> **Do not use your Minecraft server port** |
| secret | The "password" that allows access to the API                           |

Note, the plugin will not run unless you change the secret. This is explained above.

# Legal Mumbo Jumbo
The idea and base code for this project came from [TristanSMPAPI](https://github.com/twisttaan/TristanSMPAPI).
It has been extensively added to by myself with much technical help from the developers of [DiscordSRV](https://github.com/DiscordSRV/DiscordSRV/)
